# Pintos-Project-1

<P>

Welcome to Pintos.  Pintos is a simple operating system framework for
the 80<VAR>x</VAR>86 architecture.  It supports kernel threads, loading and
running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of
these in a very simple way.  In the Pintos projects, you and your
project team will strengthen its support in all three of these areas.
You will also add a virtual memory implementation.

Pintos could, theoretically, run on a regular IBM-compatible PC.
Unfortunately, it is impractical to supply every CS 140 student
a dedicated PC for use with Pintos.  Therefore, we will run Pintos projects
in a system simulator, that is, a program that simulates an 80<VAR>x</VAR>86
CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that unmodified operating
systems and software can run under it.  In class we will use the
<A HREF="http://bochs.sourceforge.net">Bochs</A> and
<A HREF="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</A> simulators.  Pintos has also been tested with
<A HREF="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware Player</A>.

These projects are hard.  CS 140 has a reputation of taking a lot of
time, and deservedly so.  We will do what we can to reduce the workload, such
as providing a lot of support material, but there is plenty of
hard work that needs to be done.  We welcome your
feedback.  If you have suggestions on how we can reduce the unnecessary
overhead of assignments, cutting them down to the important underlying
issues, please let us know.
